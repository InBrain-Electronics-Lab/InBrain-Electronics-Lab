Dr. Uguz's research mainly focuses on design and development of ultra-flexible and light 
weight neural implants that can generate a more tissue compatible interface. By miniaturizing
the recording sites, Dr. Uguz aims to develop very large-scale systems capable of recording 
or stimulating brain activity with single neuronal resolution over extended periods without 
causing tissue damage.
