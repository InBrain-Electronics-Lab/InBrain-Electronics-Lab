Our research is focused on bioelectronic interfaces for minimally-invasive inbrain applications. We are developing and testing innovative thin-film flexible and injectable electronics primarily for the investigation and treatment of epilepsy and neurodegenerative diseases. Newer applications also involve visual prosthetics.

## Projects

**Minimally-Invasive Ultrasound-Fascilitated Drug-Delivery Through the Blood-Brain Barrier
    In collaboration with the MITUS Lab at TU Delft and the Cea Group at Yale, we are working to create and test inbrain solutions for drug delivery to treat neurological conditions.

**Biocompatible Conductive Polymers for InBrain Electronics Applications
  In collaboration with the Laboratory of Organic Electronics at Linköping University, we are developing inbrain applications for a novel optically polymerized conductive polymer.

**Multi-Analyte Chemical Sensing Utilizing a Microfluidic Model with an In-built Organic ElectroChemical Transistors (OECTs)
  We are developing an organic chemical sensing platform to measure multiple analytes simultaneously.

**Fabrication of Novel OECT Geometries for Optimal Transconductance
  We are fabricating creative geometrical vertical OECTs to minimize channel length and optimize conductivity.
